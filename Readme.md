# To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application developed as part of the JavaScript course challenge at CoderHouse. The application allows you to add tasks that you need to complete during the day. It uses pure JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS. Tasks are saved using local storage, and the application also fetches weather information for your city using a weather API.
